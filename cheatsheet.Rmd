## Functions

**assignment operator** `<-` assigns values to objects, assigns a value on the right to an object on the left (from base R)  

**`c()`** function to combine values (from base R)  

**`case_when()`**  function to test multiple conditions. Can use instead of multiple `ifelse()` 

**`colnames()`** function to access column names (from base R)

**`colours()`** function to see the built-in R colours (from base R)

**console** a window where you can interactively type in commands and the output is returned

**`dev.off()`** function to turn off the R graphics device (from base R). Used after e.g. `pdf()`, `png()`.

**`dim()`** function to retrieve the dimensions of an object, for example the number of rows and columns (from base R)

**dplyr** tidyverse package for manipulating data, contains the `mutate()`, `filter()`, `select()` functions and the `%>%` operator

**`factor()`** function to convert values to factor data type (from base R)

**`filter()`** function for choosing rows (from dplyr)

**function**  pre-defined commands, can be loaded in from packages or user-created

**`gather()`** function that enables converting from wide to long (tidy) format (from dplyr)

**geoms** type of ggplot e.g. geom_bar(), geom_density(), geom_boxplot(), geom_violin(), geom_point(), geom_jitter(), geom_text()

**`geom_text_repel()`** geom to add add text non-overlapping labels (from ggrepel)

**ggplot2** a tidyverse package for data visualisation 

**`ggplot()`** function used to create a ggplot (from ggplot2)

**ggrepel** package to position non-overlapping text labels on a ggplot

**`head()`** function for selecting the first part of an object (from base R). Default is to show the first 6 items.

**`ifelse()`** function to test if a condition is true or not and return a value `ifelse(test, yes, no)` (from base R)

**`labs()`** function that can modify title, axis and legend labels on a ggplot (from ggplot2)

**`levels()`** function to retrieve the levels (category names) of a factor (from base R)

**`library()`** function to load packages (from base R)

**`log2()`** function to compute the log2 (base 2) logarithms (from base R)

**`log10()`** function to compute the log10 (base 10) logarithms (from base R)

**`mutate()`** function to add columns (from dplyr)

**object** everything in R is an object. The assignment operator `<-` can be used to create objects

**`pdf()`** function to create a pdf, used with `dev.off()` (from base R)

**pipe** `%>%` operator chains together tidyverse commands

**`pull()`** function to extract values (from dplyr)

**`read_tsv()`** function to read a tab-separated file into R (from readr)

**readr** a tidyverse pacakge for reading data into R, contains the `read_tsv()` function

**scales** scale_colour_brewer(), scale_colour_manual(), scale_x_continuous()

**script** a text file containing commands, in R a script filename ends with .R

**`select()`** function for choosing columns (from dplyr)

**`str()`** function for showing the structure of an object (from base R). Useful for checking data types.

**`summary()`** function for producing a summary of an object (from base R). Useful for getting summary statistics of numeric columns (min, max, mean, median)

**`tail()`** function for selecting the last part of an object (from base R). Default is to show the last 6 items.

**themes** the non-data components of a ggplot e.g. background, grid lines, font size and font type

**tidyverse** a collection of packages that work together for data reading, tidying, manipulating and visualising

**tidyr** a tidyverse package for data tidying, contains the `gather()` and `spread()` functions

**vector** a data structure in R, contains a collection of items of the same data type e.g c("TP53", "BRCA1")

**`View()`** function to invoke a spreadsheet-like viewer on an R object

**`&`** and  
**`|`** or  
**`==`** test if a value is the same as another value
